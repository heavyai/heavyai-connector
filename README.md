# Quick Start
```bash
yarn
npm run build
npm run docs # opens API docs in your browser.
```

# Examples

Open [example.html](example.html) in your browser for a basic query call.

# Development Guidelines

### Use Asynchronous Methods

Asynchronous Thrift client methods must always be used. Synchronous methods are deprecated and cause a bad user experience.

To ensure that the asynchronous version of the method is called, simply pass in a callback.

```js
// Bad
try {
  const response = client.query(query, options)
} catch (e) {
  throw e
}

// Good
client.query(query, options, (error, response) => {
  if (error) {
    callback(error)
  }  else {
    callback(null, response)
  }
})
```

You can even go one step further and wrap this in a Promise.

```js
// better
new Promise ((resolve, reject) => {
  client.query(query, options, (error, response) => {
    if (error) {
      reject(error)
    }  else {
      resolve(response)
    }
  })
})
```

### Error Handling

By default, the callback signature of a Thrift client method is `response => {â€¦}`. This means that the response can either be the success response or a Thrift Exception.

Since this not idiomatic JS callback style, we wrap our Thrift client methods in `wrapWithErrorHandling`, making their signature `(error, response) =>`. Refer to `/src/mapd-client-v2` for examples of how to wrap Thrift client methods in the proper error handling style.

# Testing

Everything in MapdCon should be unit-tested and linted. You can find these tests in `/test`.

The linter and all tests run on
```bash
npm test
```

### Linting

It's our eventual goal to fully lint the files in `mapd-con/src`. Try to write `libraries/mapd-con` using the `projects/dashboard-v2` Es6/7 style to make this goal easier to achieve.
