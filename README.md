# Quick Start
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run docs # opens API docs in your browser.
```
# Documentation
Visit our [API Docs](http://mapd.github.io/mapd-connector/docs/)

# Example

Open [example.html](http://mapd.github.io/mapd-connector/example) in your browser for a basic query call.

# Testing

Everything in MapdCon should be unit-tested and linted. You can find these tests in `/test`.

The linter and all tests run on
```bash
npm test
```

### Linting

It's our eventual goal to fully lint the files in `mapd-con/src`. Try to write `libraries/mapd-con` using the `projects/dashboard-v2` Es6/7 style to make this goal easier to achieve.
